        <h4>Coding && Community</h4>
        <p>
          Coding && Community is a STEM-themed community service club that seeks to close the gender and race
          disparities in the field of computer science. I first discovered Coding && Community as a freshman during
          the annual Activity Fair. After attending a couple of their general meetings, I applied and accepted
          a volunteering position as a Java Instructor for Troy High School students. During this time, I attended
          their high school computer science class and directly mentored students through the programs that they
          were designing. Not only did this solidify my skills and confidence in Java programming, but it also 
          helped students who were not as fortunate enough to attend a school with a solid curriculum for computer
          science education. I want to help these students have better access to a STEM education, and therefore,
          Coding && Community would like to establish an AP Computer Science A course by the end of 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being a Java Instructor, I also volunteer as a STEP Instructor for Coding && Community's 
          STEP program. The STEP program teaches computer science principles to middle and high school students 
          in the Troy area. One of my main responsibilities is to develop the brand new curriculum for Cryptography
          and Cybersecurity, and taught the curriculum virtually (due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

        <h4>Association for Computing Machinery - Women's Division (ACM-W)</h4>
        <p>
          The ACM-W division at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute supports female and non-binary students pursuing a 
          degree in Computer Science. Weekly meetings are held in which members can be mentored by Comptuer Science
          professors. ACM-W also runs a mentor program for first-year students majoring in computer science, in which
          we assist them in progressing through their freshman year.

        <h4>National Girls Collaborative Project (NGCP) - National Girls Advisory Board</h4>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the NGCP is to encourage girls to the fields of STEM. As a member of 
          the NGCP Girls Advisory Board, I provide feedback to the projects sponsored by the NGCP. I 
          offer support for projects through volunteering, and as a Collegiate Member, I mentor the 
          younger women on the Advisory Board!
