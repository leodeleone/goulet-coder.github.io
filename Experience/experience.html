      <h3>Enlighten.Net</h3>
      <h4>Back-End Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time-Frame: June - August 2020</h4>
      <p>
          I had returned during the Summer of 2020 to continue my work with Enlighten.Net. Development was mainly
          done using C# and the .NET framework. We managed our projects using DevOps and the Visual Studio Community 
          IDE. I worked on their ENet Docs application. Here are some of the things that I worked on during the summer!
          <ul>
            <li>
                First, I continued my initial implementation on the main enhancement I worked on last summer, which was
                to add a storage provider which would programatically upload storage items to the Amazon S3 Bucket. I 
                changed the initial provider to include storage items from Enlighten.Net
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, I updated their configuration system to further customize our Amazon S3 storage provider. Using the 
                Windows Registry, I set up the Amazon S3 Bucket Configuration within the customer's configuration, allowing 
                them to use one of Enlighten.Net's four buckets (which were distributed among the four Availability Zones 
                throughout the US) and, if they have one, use one of their own buckets. I also added the configuration in 
                which the user can have a default bucket, or they can specify a bucket to store each type of file (for example
                they can have a default bucket where everything is stored, but can specify a bucket for just their PDF files).
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, I resolved a couple of bugs within their Web API. Specifically, I provided a solution for their 'Save'
                button, which at times was enabled when it should not have been. I also added functionality to a 'Sign and
                Move' button, in which if the user had permission to upload a file, they would automatically give permission
                to save the file (usually, the person would have to sign their request before saving it).
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, I began my implementation for a VerifyBucket tool. This command-line tool, given the company ID, would
                synchronize our database with the data that is stored in each Amazon bucket they have listed and report any
                differences between our database and the data in their Amazon Bucket/s.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics (HEALS) Project</h3>
      <h4>Front-End Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time Frame: Feburary - August 2020</h4>
      <p>
        During my second semester, I applied for and was accepted to the HEALS Project as an undergraduate research assistant. While
        I was employed, I primarily worked on the application's graphical user interface using pure HTML/CSS and Javascript/JSON, while 
        collaborating on work using the Node-Red environment. Here are some of the things I worked on during my time.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was mainly responsible for creating the front-end of the application. I would receive a template design for the website, and
            I would implement the design in HTML/CSS. In total, there were 2 redesigns involved in creating the HEALS front-end application. 
            Additionally, I was the main consultant for any changes or updates to the GUI, and was responsible for the organizational portion
            of their data representation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another change that I made was to use data sent from the server (JSON format) to dynamically edit and update the information. One
            of the problems I discovered was that when the user was manipulating the data, while the changes were being stored in the current 
            instance of the JSON data, those changes were not being stored within the server. With the help of a colleague, we used the Node-Red
            technologies to update these changes to the server. 
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Enlighten.Net</h3>
      <h4>Back-End Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time-Frame: June - August 2019</h4>
      <p>
          During the summer of 2019, I interned at Enlighten.Net as a back-end software developer. Development was mainly
          done using C# and the .NET framework. We managed our projects using DevOps and the Visual Studio Community 
          IDE. I worked on their ENet Docs application. Here are some of the things that I worked on during the summer!
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the main issues that Enlighten.Net was facing was the efficient storage of their documents. ENet Docs stores
              millions of files, and while Enlighten.Net was able to store these documents on their on-site servers, they frequently
              had to add hard drives, and managing their servers were becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, they have decided to 
              move to storing incoming documents on the cloud. After some research, they decided that Amazon S3 would best suit their needs.
              
              I was primarily responsible for researching Amazon S3, analyzing whether it truly fit the needs of Enlighten.Net, and looking for 
              any pitfalls that could potentially harm the ENet Docs product. I then implemented a simple storage provider that allows the application
              to upload, stream, or delete documents stored on Amazon S3. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, I began to organize ENet Doc's configuration settings into a JSON file, and learned the basics of Web APIs.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Mobile Apps for Hartford</h3>
      <h4>Mobile Software Developer</h4>
      <h4>Time-Frame: July - August 2018</h4>
      <p>
          Throughout the summer of 2018, I participated in the Mobile Apps for Hartford program, an employment opportunity for top-performing high school
          students that have completed the mobile AP Computer Science Principles course (for more information about the course, please visit
          <a href="https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/course?use_last_location=true">https://course.mobilecsp.org/mobilecsp/course?use_last_location=true</a>
          ) students spend a month working alongside Computer Science students at Trinity College on a mobile application that will benefit a non-profit 
          organization in Hartford, CT. Development is done using MIT App Inventor 2, a block-based programming language.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I primarily worked on the development of Nisimo, a mobile application that is designed to relieve the stress of therapists. I developed 
          the Guided Imagery exercises, which allows therapists to upload and remove (if they so choose) their own pictures, browse through different
          musical playlists, and view an image in full-screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Throughout the internship, I was also in charge of creating the logo, managing the documentation for Nisimo, and keeping contact with
          our client.
